# LinuxCNC on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B GPIO

This repo contains a rudimentary LinuxCNC configuration for using a Pi 4B to drive stepper motors via GPIO.
I've tried to add extra verbose comments to aid in understanding, as some of the configuration is not trivial.
This has not been tested with actual hardware yet.
